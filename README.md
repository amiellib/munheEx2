Description 

We have 5 packages to describe layers of GIS in google earth. By building it from scratch. We first had to describe points in a 3D world both in curtesy and polar, then we built function to do with those points, We then had to give points description (metadata), and we created GIS elements that had the geo point and its metadata, and finally we added them to layers/projects. 
We also added a utilities to upload csv files to convert to KML files that could help visualize the locations in google earth.
